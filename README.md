# Introduction
On June 15th, the Danish Emergency Management Agency (*Beredskabsstyrelsen*) published "Forberedt på kriser"[^1] (*Prepared for crises*), which gives recommendations on how to survive 3 days in case of a larger crisis or disaster.

This is the most crucial step as you will be spending a lot of time here.

## Where?
The basement can be your best option.  

## When?
Immediately! Do not hesitate as every second counts. 

## With who?
Your family or close ones. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when sharing your position! As the enemy could use it to locate civilians.


# 🥫 Supplies
## Food
Assuming the food is stored correctly:
- Canned food (1-2 years)
- Rations (5-30 years)
- Honey (forever)
- Biscuits/Crackers (6-9 months)
- Spices (2-4 years)
- Nuts (6-12 months)

Since you can't have a varied dired, I would suggest as a good addition to your meal to eat vitamins, such as **Vitamin D**, **Calcium**, **Magnessium**, etc... Especially when you don't get your natural vitamins from the sun.

## Water
Water needs to be stored correctly.
In the event of an atomic or chemical bomb, the drinking water from the faucet won't be reliable, as it would be contaminated, and the negative effects would pose a higher risk if consumed.

# 🧰 Equipment
